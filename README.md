## Summary

[I'm a Senior]: https://www.dragonball-multiverse.com/en/fan-arts.html

My name is Kai Howard. I'm a student at New Tech Institute and do time at SICTC for Computer Science with Mr. Bander. I enjoy Writing code and getting into the nitty gritty of how it works. Outside School I like to draw art of my favorite show DBZ and sometimes I'll draw something else. I also like Martial Arts, currently I am learning Jiu Jistu and Judo. Lastly when I get time to: I'll play some video games with my friends to unwind and relax, even though we end up yelling at each other for a stupid thing or another. Despite all that though we have fun through it all.
