## Summary

[I'm a Senior]: https://www.dragonball-multiverse.com/en/fan-arts.html

My name is Kai Howard. I'm a student at New Tech Institute and do time at SICTC for Computer Science with Mr. Bander. I enjoy writing code and getting into the nitty gritty of how it works. After High School I plan on going to Murray State to pursue a Cyber-Security Major. After College I hope to get into a Cryptology ( The Decryption and Encryption of Coded messages ) related field. Outside of school I like to produce art of my favorite show, Dragon Ball Z, and sometimes I'll draw something else. I also enjoy Martial Arts, currently I am learning Jiu-Jitsu and Judo. Lastly when I get time to: I'll play some video games with my friends to unwind and relax, even though we all end up yelling at each other for one thing or another. Despite all that though, we have fun through it all.
